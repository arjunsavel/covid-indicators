# covid-indicators
California's defined some indicators that track the state's progress with the COVID-19 pandemic; this visualizes those indicators.

Some used (based on [this report](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.7.20-Presentation.pdf) from the state):

- Epidemiologic stability: No more than 1 case per 10,000 people in the last 14 days; no COVID-19 death in the past 14 days
- Testing capacity: Minimum daily testing of 1.5 per 1,000 residents
- Containment capacity: At least 15 contact tracers per 100,000 residents; Ability to temporarily house at least 15% of county residents experiencing homelessness
- Hospital capacity: County or regional capacity to accommodate a minimum surge of 35%; Hospital facilities must have a robust plan to protect hospital workforce

## CAVEATS
- I am not an epidemiologist â€” nor am I a data scientist. I'm an astronomer in training; so, I try to keep as close to the data as possible, citing sources when available, and restricting my contributions to visualizations.
